1. ifconfig   (mine is 10.133.6.82)
2. grep `hostname` /etc/hosts
3. nslookup <ip>
4. scp [options] username1@source_host:directory1/filename1 username2@destination_host:directory2/filename2
5. lsof -i:<port> (see note)
6. lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN (see note)
(note: for 5 and 6, the following should work as well for an *explicitly* given host: nc -z <host> <port(s)> however, nc is not currently working on my version of linux).
7. curl <website> -o <filename>
8. curl -I <website>
9. curl -v <website>  (gives verbose ouptut; lines that start with > indicate outgoing headers, as opposed to < for incoming)
